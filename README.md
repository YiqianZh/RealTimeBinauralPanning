# RealTimeBinauralPanning
My implementation of a Real-Time Binaural panning designed on the BeagleBone Black (BBB) with the Bela Audio Shield

The approach considered utilises an Accelerometer to position the sound source. 
The sound source localisation is done using the inter-aural level differences (ILD) and head-related transfer function for sound positioning and pinna reflections for the perception of elevation. In addition, filtering and band boosting techniques are also included for increasing the elevation and the depth perception capability.
